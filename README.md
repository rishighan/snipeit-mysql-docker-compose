# snipeit-mysql-docker-compose

A docker-compose configuration for [SnipeIt](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it) with a MySQL container configured.

Where applicable, replace anything in `<>` with your actual values. 

Things you should consider changing:

1. SnipeIT port
2. SnipeIT hostname
3. MySQL root password

Most of the other configuration should work as-is
